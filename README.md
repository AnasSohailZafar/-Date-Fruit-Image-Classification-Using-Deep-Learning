# -Date-Fruit-Image-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify date fruit images into different classes. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and evaluated using test data. The repository also includes code for data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and visualization of results.
